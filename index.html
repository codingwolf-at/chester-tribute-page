            <h2>About</h2>
            <p id="text">Chester Charles Bennington was an American singer, songwriter, and occasional actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist for Linkin Park and was also the lead vocalist for the bands Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise and Stone Temple Pilots. Chester has been credited by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation. During a concert chester once broke his wrist on stage, instead of stopping the whole show he carried on performing and waited until after the show to go to the emergency room. That is dedication.</p>
